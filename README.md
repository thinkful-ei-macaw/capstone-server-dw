Welcome to Version 1 of my very first full-stack app, Flash. A user can create a project and upload flash cards to it. A user can then view flash cards, as well as update and delete an existing project or card. This app was deployed with Zeit on the client side and Heroku on the back end. This app is a React App developed with JS,NodeJs,Postgresql,and Vanilla CSS.
